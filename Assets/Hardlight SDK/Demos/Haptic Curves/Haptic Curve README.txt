This is content that demonstrates the DirectMode (previously called Volume Mode)

Direct Mode is experimental right now, so there is no promises that it'll stick around.

The HapticCurve class is exploratory and demonstrative. It still has a few bugs to iron out.

The core idea is to allow for more direct and fine control for multi-area effects.
